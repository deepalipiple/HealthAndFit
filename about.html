			<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
			<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Burpee</dt>
				<dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position. <span class="viewex" onclick="burpees()"></span></dd>
				
				<dt>Plank</dt>
				<dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can. <span class="viewex" onclick="plank()"></span> </dd>
				
				<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
				<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain). <span class="viewex" onclick="mountain()"></span></dd>
				
				<dt>Pull-Up</dt>
				<dd>A pull-up is an upper-body strength exercise. The pull-up is a closed-chain movement where the body is suspended by the hands and pulls up. <span class="viewex" onclick="pull-up()"></span></dd>
			     
			     <dt>Push-Up</dt>
				<dd>A push-up is a common calisthenics exercise beginning from the prone position. By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the pectoral muscles, triceps, and anterior deltoids, with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis and the midsection as a whole. <span class="viewex" onclick="push-up()"></span></dd>
                
                <dt>Squat</dt>
				<dd>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. <span class="viewex" onclick="push-up()"></span></dd>
                
                <dt>Crunch</dt>
				<dd>Crunches, also known as abdominal crunches, are a core exercise designed to target your abdominal muscles—specifically your rectus abdominis (the six-pack muscle) and your obliques. Perform crunches by lying face-up with your feet hip-width apart. While keeping your lower back on the floor, lift your upper back and shoulder blades off of the floor. <span class="viewex" onclick="push-up()"></span></dd>
